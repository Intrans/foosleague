# The example below shows how to configure Stationary to allow public
# access to the pages behind devise and also set the root directory for
# Stationary to look for template files.
#Stationary.configure do |config|
#  config.root               = "#{Rails.root}/app/views/site"
#  config.skip_before_filter = :authenticate_user!
#end
